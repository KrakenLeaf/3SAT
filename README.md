1. Overview

	We present a MATLAB code for simultaneous sparsity-based super-resolution and tracking (3SAT).
	3SAT combines weighted sparse recovery with simultaneous tracking of the individual microbubbles (MBs) to achieve sub-diffraction resolution in (low frame-rate) contrast enhanced ultrasound.
	MBs flow inside blood vessels, hence their movement from one frame to the next is structured. Therefore, MBs are more likely to be found in certain areas of the next frame, given their current locations. 
	Each MB track is used to estimate the position of the MBs and fill-in for the missing spatial information due to low-rate scanning, thus providing a smooth depiction of the super-resolved vessels.
	The code provided here is self-contained and includes all necessary functions. 
	
	Currently, the implementation is single core, but can be extended to multi-core processing.
	
	The code includes an example configuration file and an example simulated movie, along with its by-products.
	
	This code is for academic purposes only.

2. Requirements

	• MATLAB R2016a or newer (previous versions require modifications).
	• At least 8GB RAM; 64GB or more is recommended.


3. Installation and basic operation
	
	To Install:
	-----------
	1. Unpack the archive and add the 3SAT_V1 folder to the MATLAB path.
	2. AddPathList.m - adds all releveant directories to the path. Can be run once.
	
	To run    :
	-----------
	1. Main.m               - Main file. Just need to run it.
		1. VERBOSE         : 1, 2 - Display massages to screen, 0 - do not display.
		2. DEBUG 		   : 1, 2 - Debug modes (display), 0 - no debug mode.
		3. VIDEO		   : -1 - no video is recorded. 
		4. InternalSaveFlag: 1 - save results to disk, 0 - do not save.
	2. ConfigFile_sim_1.txt - Configuration file. Parameters are changed from this file. Description for different parameters are inside the file.
	
	Main internal functions:
	------------------------
	1. FlowSR.m       - Main computation script, which is called from Main.m.
	2. DrawCovGauss.m - Generates the weighting matrix for each frame.

	2. KalmanFlow.m 			 - Kalman innovation.
	3. KalmanPropagator.m 		 - Applies Kalman filter propagation equations. 
	4. MHT_init.m 				 - Initialize the MHT algorithm.
	5. MHT_track_frame.m 	     - Performs tracking of detected MBs in a frame.
	6. TrackManager.m 		     - Main file for tracking and managing MB tracks.
	
	
	'OF\':
	1. OFestimator_Preprocess.m - Pre-processing calculations for optical flow estimation.
	2. OFestimator.m 			- Optical flow estimation.
	
	'OptEngine\':
